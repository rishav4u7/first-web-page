             <h3>Who We Are</h3>
               <p>It is never easy to start a business. You need to work on your ideas, find capital and investors and then you need to work hard to get results.
 Ask those who have succeeded, they tell you it is the best feeling ever when an idea takes off to places.
Snapdeal set a niche for itself in the sphere of e-commerce in India. In 2010, when Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal wanted to start their own business, they chose an offline couponing business and named it MoneySaver. 
15000 coupons were sold in three months and it was time to take the business to the next level.The company’s growth had been phenomenal but it is their continued effort to bring the best to the market and their zeal to succeed as the best B2C (Business to customer) marketplace is what sets them apart.
It is action and not mere thought that gives results</p>
